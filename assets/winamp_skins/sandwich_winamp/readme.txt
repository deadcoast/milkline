NOTE: With the exception of the wallpapers, everything in SANDWICH SUITE IS 'OPEN SOURCE.'
Consider permissions granted to edit and distribute the skins as you like, so long as no money is being made off their distribution and both nuance and the original author are credited.

Installation instructions:
- Make sure you have the font standard 07_57 caps installed (which can be found in the Fonts folder with this release)
-  If using standard caps, or any other pixel font,  go to options > skins > classic skins, and click "use skinned font for main window title display
- For the font to display correctly, go to options > preferences > options > display, and set the Playlist Font Size to "8"

Credits:
To claim this as a solo effort would be a lie of great proportions. The design was concieved by akka and myself.  Some elements from blueslaad's Sincerity II Winamp skin were used, which can be found here http://blueslaad.deviantart.com/art/Sincerity-II-33697075

Enjoy,
